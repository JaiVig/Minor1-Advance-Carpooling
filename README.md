# Minor1-Advance-Carpooling
The project aims to schedule different passengers with the ongoing vehicles to their destination on a day to day commute basis. It asks users for their preference(i.e. if the user wants to go in a car whose route offers optimal distance/optimal road condition/optimal traffic).
